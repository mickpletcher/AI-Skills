  itinerary", "travel plan", "export my trip", "format this itinerary", or
  describes an upcoming trip and asks Claude to organize it. Produces a

# Travel Itinerary Skill

## Intent

Build practical travel itineraries with route notes, lodging context, pacing, budget visibility, and export-ready structure.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not use for broad destination comparison, live booking, visa/legal advice, or unsafe assumptions about current availability.
- Required context is missing and cannot be reasonably inferred.
- A more specific skill in this repo is a better match.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] The output matches the skill's intended task and platform.
- [ ] Required inputs, assumptions, and uncertainty are explicit.
- [ ] Safety, scope, and source limits are respected.
- [ ] The response follows the requested format or the skill's default output format.
- [ ] The result is practical enough to use without another cleanup pass.

Build Obsidian-formatted trip files from user supplied details. This skill is a reusable template for organizing travel plans into a clean Markdown itinerary.

## Primary Triggers

**`trip`** or **`itinerary`** — Execute immediately. No clarifying questions before producing the first draft.

Other triggers: "plan my trip", "build my itinerary", "travel plan for...", "export this trip", "format my itinerary"

Infer the best trip template before drafting:

- `city trip`
- `road trip`
- `active travel`
- `mixed work and leisure`

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1 — Extract Trip Data

Pull everything available from the conversation. Do not ask clarifying questions if enough info exists to produce a useful draft. Extract:

- **Destination(s)** and order of travel
- **Dates** — departure, return, any fixed anchor events
- **Anchor events** — concerts, races, festivals, sporting events with fixed dates (e.g., Tour de France Grand Départ, Running of the Bulls)
- **Accommodation type** — hotel, hostel private room, Airbnb, resort, camping, or user specified preference
- **Lodging constraints** — preferred neighborhoods, price ceiling, transit needs, late check-in needs, luggage storage needs, and location tradeoffs
- **Departure airport or origin** — if provided
- **Transport** — flights, trains, ferries, buses
- **Border crossings** — countries entered, entry method, visa or ETA needs, passport validity, onward ticket needs, and likely checkpoint dates
- **Budget target** — total or daily
- **Known activities** or goals per destination
- **Trip purpose** — adventure, event-based, exploration, endurance event, etc.
- **Trip template fit** — city trip, road trip, active travel, or mixed work and leisure

If key data is missing (e.g., no dates at all), produce the best possible draft with placeholders and flag gaps at the bottom.

### Step 2 — Build the Markdown File

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD_[Destination].md` using the departure date.
Example: `2026-07-01_Spain-Morocco.md`

Use this template structure, omitting any section with no data:

```markdown
# [Trip Name]
**Dates:** [Departure] — [Return] ([X] days)
**Destinations:** [City 1 → City 2 → City 3]
**Budget Target:** $X,XXX total / ~$XXX/day
**Departure Point:** [Airport / City / Region]
**Purpose:** [One-line description]
**Template:** [City Trip / Road Trip / Active Travel / Mixed Work + Leisure]

### Template Guidance

Adjust emphasis by template:

- `city trip`: denser day plans, neighborhood flow, museum or restaurant timing, transit realism
- `road trip`: driving blocks, parking, fuel or charging notes, check-in timing, scenic or backup stop logic
- `active travel`: training or event anchors, recovery windows, gear, nutrition, and weather contingency emphasis
- `mixed work and leisure`: protected work blocks, quieter lodging needs, Wi-Fi or workspace notes, lighter sightseeing pacing on work days

### Arrival And Departure Day Templates

Use these patterns when the trip includes red-eye flights, late check-in, early departure, overnight trains, long drives, or major time zone changes.

**Red-eye arrival day:**
- Keep the first day light.
- Add early bag drop or luggage storage.
- Put only one anchor activity after hotel check-in unless the user already has a fixed event.
- Add a nap or recovery block when arrival is before normal check-in.
- Note shower, meal, and transit logistics before sightseeing.

**Late check-in arrival day:**
- Prioritize airport or station transfer, food availability, and check-in cutoff.
- Add backup lodging contact details or after-hours instructions.
- Avoid nonessential activities after arrival.
- Flag if the arrival time risks missing the property's check-in window.

**Departure day:**
- Work backward from flight, train, ferry, or drive departure time.
- Include checkout, luggage storage, final meal, transfer time, security or border buffer, and backup transport.
- Keep activities near lodging or the departure station.
- Flag early departures that require a pre-booked taxi, airport hotel, or previous-night repositioning.

### Step 3 — Validate Before Exporting

Before writing the file, check for:

- **Date math** — day count, transit days, anchor event alignment
- **Logic gaps** — overnight transit without accommodation, missing arrival day
- **Budget realism** — flag if estimated total is significantly over or under the stated target
- **Accommodation alignment** — keep lodging recommendations consistent with the user's stated preference and compare location, price, and transit convenience
- **Routing assumptions** — note when a connection or transfer is likely required
- **Visa and border checkpoints** — flag every multi-country entry, likely visa or ETA requirement, passport validity issue, onward ticket issue, and unverified border rule
- **Arrival and departure day realism** — add red-eye, late check-in, early checkout, luggage storage, and airport or station buffer notes when relevant
- **Daily structure realism** — do not overload a day beyond likely transit, meal, and pacing limits
- **Meal spacing** — note when long activity or transit blocks should have a real meal or snack plan
- **Contingency coverage** — add backup notes for weather, delays, or a failed booking dependency when relevant

Flag issues in the Open Items section, not inline in the itinerary.

### Step 4 — Output expectations

Produce the itinerary content directly unless the user explicitly asks for a file to be created in a local repo or folder.

When you finish, confirm:

1. the filename you would use
2. the date range covered
3. any flagged gaps or open items

---

## Rules

- **No fabricated bookings.** If it's not confirmed, mark it TBD.
- **No visa or border guarantees.** Treat visa, ETA, passport validity, customs, and border guidance as a checklist for verification, not legal advice.
- **Budget columns stay separate.** Estimated vs. Actual — never merge them. Actual fills in as the itinerary is updated.
- **Lodging notes must explain tradeoffs.** Compare location, price, and transit convenience when suggesting or summarizing accommodation.
- **Arrival and departure days need buffer.** Red-eye arrivals, late check-ins, early departures, and overnight transit require lighter plans and explicit logistics notes.
- **Packing list is trip-specific.** Add or remove items based on destination, climate, and activities.
- **Packing and reservation rollups should stay concise.** They are quick-reference sections, not duplicates of the full itinerary.
- **Anchor events are fixed.** Build the day-by-day around confirmed event dates — never shift them to fit travel convenience.
- **Obsidian tables must render cleanly.** Use pipe-formatted markdown tables throughout. All tables must be Dataview-compatible.
- **No fluff.** This is a logistics document. No preamble, no sign-offs, no "have a great trip!" copy.

## Template Guidance

- Use placeholders when essential trip details are missing
- Preserve user supplied naming, destination order, and travel style
- Keep the output neutral and reusable so it works for solo, couple, family, or group travel

## Help And Examples

If the user is not sure how to use this skill, asks what it needs, or asks for examples:

- Explain in plain language what this skill can do.
