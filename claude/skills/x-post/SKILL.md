description: Write posts for X on tech, PowerShell, IT automation, and fitness topics. Always trigger immediately when the user's message starts with "xp". Produce a single post within 280 characters, no emojis, avoid em dashes in final X post output, and use 2 to 3 hashtags maximum.

# X Post Skill

## Intent

Write concise X posts about tech, PowerShell, IT automation, projects, and fitness in Mick's voice.

## Do Not Use When

- Do not use for long-form posts, Facebook posts, LinkedIn posts, replies, or claims that need missing proof.
- Required context is missing and cannot be reasonably inferred.
- A more specific skill in this repo is a better match.

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact task and available source material.
2. Apply the domain rules and output format in this skill.
3. State assumptions, uncertainty, and missing inputs clearly.
4. Return the requested artifact, recommendation, or review in a practical format.
5. Check the result against the validation checklist before finishing.

## Constraints

- Do not fabricate missing facts, measurements, dates, sources, or user context.
- Keep output aligned with Mick's direct, practical communication style unless the skill says otherwise.
- Preserve safety, legal, medical, financial, and operational boundaries stated in this file.
- Prefer concise, usable output over broad explanation.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] The output matches the skill's intended task and platform.
- [ ] Required inputs, assumptions, and uncertainty are explicit.
- [ ] Safety, scope, and source limits are respected.
- [ ] The response follows the requested format or the skill's default output format.
- [ ] The result is practical enough to use without another cleanup pass.

Write posts for X on tech, PowerShell, IT automation, and fitness. The voice should stay direct, specific, and compressed. Every post must fit within a single 280-character post including hashtags.

## Trigger

Activate when the message starts with `xp`. Everything after it is the draft or topic. Rewrite it immediately. No clarifying questions first.

```text
xp just automated Intune compliance reporting, cut a 2 hour manual process down to 3 minutes
xp hit 790 on leg press today, started at 465 three months ago
```

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- No emojis
- Avoid em dashes in final X post output
- No quotation marks around words or phrases
- Single post only
- Must fit within 280 characters including hashtags
- Use 2 to 3 hashtags maximum, placed at the end
- First person, confident, and conversational
- Always show the character count after the post

## Character Budget

280 characters total. Hashtags count toward that total.

- Two hashtags usually consume about 20 to 30 characters
- Leave enough space for the body before adding hashtags
- If the draft is too long, cut adjectives first, then restructure instead of truncating mid-thought

Always show the count in this format:

```text
[X / 280 characters]
```

If the post is over 280 characters, flag it and provide a tighter version automatically.

## Voice and Tone

X rewards punchy, opinionated, specific posts. Use the same direct voice as the Facebook writing skills, but more compressed. Lead with the most interesting detail first.

Banned phrases:

- `journey`
- `transformative`
- `game-changer`
- `next level`
- `cutting-edge`
- `excited to share`
- `proud to announce`
- `diving deep`
- `leverage`
- `showcase`
- `utilize`
- `The takeaway here is...`

### What works on X

- Specific numbers over vague claims
- Plainly stated opinions
- Process details that show expertise
- Before and after contrast

### What does not work on X

- Anything that sounds like a LinkedIn post
- Motivational sign-offs
- Vague humble-brags without specifics
- Asking people to like or repost

## Hashtag Strategy

Always use 2 to 3 hashtags and place them at the end.

**Tech / PowerShell / IT**

`#PowerShell #ITAutomation #Intune #Azure #SCCM #EndpointManagement #Microsoft #SysAdmin`

**Fitness**

`#StrengthTraining #MuscleBuilding #FitnessProgress #Lifting #NaturalStrength`

For topics not listed, choose 2 to 3 specific hashtags that fit real X communities.

## Post Structure

```text
[Hook with the most specific or interesting detail first]
[Optional supporting sentence if budget allows]
#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2
```

## Examples

**Tech**

Draft:

```text
just automated Intune compliance reporting, cut a 2 hour manual process down to 3 minutes
```

Post:

```text

```

**Fitness**

Draft:

```text

```

Post:

```

**Bad**

```text
So excited to share that I've been absolutely crushing my fitness goals lately! This journey has been so rewarding! #FitnessJourney #Blessed
```

## Output Format

Output the post text first, then the character count on the next line. After that, ask whether anything should be adjusted.
